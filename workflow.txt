I will make a App usage Tracker.......

15.3.22 - 10:03 am :- 
1.Start by creating a folder and a file.
2.I want to know which all applications are open currently and for how long they are open.
3.It shows a graph of the usage 
5.I started by google searching "how to know the time a particular applications was active through python"
6.got to know about psutil library from geeksforgeeks it measures the cpu usage
7.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBLYcvPl1MA found out this video on automatic app usage time tracking 
8.maybe it can run a loop and keep checking active windows and the loop can end when the shutdown window is active.
9.I was facing problem with win32gui library so looked on for it's alternatives, found a articles on geeksforgeeks. https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-get-list-of-running-processes/ and https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-check-if-an-application-is-open-in-python/
10.WMI is amazing python library. Read about wmi on Pypi.org and It's documentation 
11.I want to know the current open tabs in the browser
12.it'll save all the data in a txt file with the current date and time 
13.I found about a library called subprocesses for the browser thing

16.3.22 - 8:52 am :- 
1.I start by reading subprocesses docs.
2.Before i began reading, i got an idea That i record when an application is closed or opened
i searched the following :- how to print when an application is closed or opened via python
3.Found some results on stackoverflow but it was kinda useless, i wasnt finding great results
4.Moved to read the docs which is the most boring task in the world

12.7.22 - 8:42 am :-
1.Resuming the project after 4 months.....
2.I got a idea, if the program continously monitored the application, it would result in a 
serious lag. So what it would do is, it would check when an application is opened and when 
it is closed. it would note both the timestamps when it is opened and closed. it would 
subtract the closing time from the opening time. And we would get the time for which was 
opened.
3.websites i went to:-
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7787120/check-if-a-process-is-running-or-not-on-windows
https://www.codegrepper.com/code-examples/python/python+check+if+an+application+is+opened
https://www.w3resource.com/python-exercises/file/python-io-exercise-16.php
https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/file-operation
4.Found Psutil -  library for retrieving information on running processes and system utilization 
(CPU, memory, disks, network, sensors) in Python. It is useful mainly for system monitoring,
profiling, limiting process resources and the management of running processes
